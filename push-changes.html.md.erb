<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step youâ€™ll learn how to propagate a local change to the application through to <%= vars.product_short %>. As a simple change, we'll modify the title which the app shows.

Change the `title` property in the `routes/index.js` file to 'I am awesome!'. Your final result should look something like this:

```javascript
'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'I am awesome!' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

Now test locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ npm start
</pre>

Visiting your application at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>, you should see the changed title. **You are awesome!**

Now deploy. All you need to do is `cf push` again:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-nodejs-app
</pre>

Finally, check that everything is working by visiting your app's URL from your web browser.

<div style="text-align:center;margin:3em;">
  <a href="./environment.html" class="btn btn-primary">I can push local changes</a>
</div>
